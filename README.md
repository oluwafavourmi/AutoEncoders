# AutoEncoders
This Repository will give explanations on different variations of AutoEncoders.

Dimensionality Reduction using AutoEncoders:
In the AutoEncoder-Dimensionality-Reduction.ipynb file, the crop dataset was taken and dimensionality reduction was performed on the x variables reducing the dataset from 7 to 2(the latent space representation). The KMeans Algorithm was further used to cluster the datapoints in the dataset to their respective classes.
